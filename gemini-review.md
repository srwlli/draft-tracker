# Gemini Code Review

**Code Context**: [Language/Framework: TypeScript/Next.js] [Project Type: Web Application] [Target Environment: Production]

## 1. Code Quality & Readability
- **Rating**: ✅ Good
- **Variable/function naming conventions**: Generally clear and consistent (e.g., `handleDraftPlayer`, `createServerSupabaseAdminClient`).
- **Code organization and structure**: Well-organized. The use of `(auth)` route groups, `components/ui`, and `lib` for shared logic is excellent. The API routes are structured logically.
- **Comment quality and documentation**: Good in some places, especially in `lib/clipboard.ts`. However, many components and hooks lack comments explaining their purpose and props.
- **Complexity assessment (cognitive load)**: Most components are simple and focused. The `DraftAdminPage` and `PlayerRankings` components are complex due to state management and multiple data sources, but are reasonably well-managed with hooks and context.

## 2. Performance Analysis
- **Rating**: ✅ Good
- **Time/space complexity issues**: The parallel queries in `src/app/api/public/drafts/[id]/route.ts` are a great example of performance optimization.
- **Bottleneck identification**: The client-side filtering and sorting of players in `DraftAdminPage` and `DraftViewerPage` could become a bottleneck with a very large player list. This is acceptable for the current scale but could be optimized further with server-side pagination/filtering if needed.
- **Memory usage patterns**: The in-memory rate limiting in `middleware.ts` is a potential memory leak on a large scale, as noted in the code comments. For a production application with significant traffic, a distributed cache like Redis would be more appropriate.
- **Optimization opportunities with measurable impact**:
    - **Image Optimization**: No usage of `next/image` was found. Using it would automatically optimize images for different devices and screen sizes, improving load times.
    - **Bundle Size**: While not explicitly analyzed, the number of dependencies seems reasonable. A bundle analyzer could be run to identify any large, unnecessary packages.

## 3. Security Audit
- **Rating**: ⚠️ Needs Attention
- **Input validation gaps**: Excellent use of `zod` for input validation on API routes like `POST /api/drafts` and `POST /api/drafts/[id]/picks`. This is a major strength.
- **Authentication/authorization flaws**:
    - **Admin Token Exposure**: The `admin_token` is passed in the URL (`/draft/[draftId]/admin/[adminToken]`). This is a security risk as URLs can be logged in browser history, server logs, and referrer headers. The token should be passed in an HTTP header (`x-admin-token` is already used for API calls, which is good) or in the request body.
    - **CSRF**: The application does not seem to have CSRF protection. While Supabase's token-based auth provides some protection, explicit CSRF tokens are recommended for form submissions.
- **Data exposure risks**: The public draft endpoint (`/api/public/drafts/[id]`) correctly omits sensitive data like `admin_token` and `user_id`. This is good.
- **Injection vulnerabilities**: The use of Supabase's query builder and RPC functions mitigates SQL injection risks. No obvious injection vulnerabilities were found.

## 4. Standards Compliance
- **Rating**: ✅ Good
- **Language-specific best practices**: The use of TypeScript is strong, with types defined in `src/types/index.ts`. The use of modern React features like hooks and context is well-implemented.
- **Framework conventions**: The project follows Next.js conventions well, including the App Router, API routes, and middleware.
- **Code style guide adherence**: The code is consistently formatted, likely due to a tool like Prettier.
- **Architecture pattern compliance**: The use of a client-side API wrapper (`lib/api-client.ts`) is a good pattern. The separation of server-side and client-side Supabase clients is also correct.

## 5. Bug Detection
- **Rating**: ⚠️ Needs Attention
- **Logic errors and edge cases**:
    - In `usePollingFallback.ts`, the polling continues even if the browser tab is not visible. This can be optimized by using the Page Visibility API to pause polling when the tab is in the background.
    - In `DraftAdminPage`, the `recentlyCreatedPicks` ref is cleared after 5 seconds. If a real-time update takes longer than 5 seconds to arrive, a duplicate pick could be rendered. A more robust solution would be to use a transaction ID or a more sophisticated deduplication mechanism.
- **Error handling gaps**: The `ErrorBoundary` component is a great catch-all. However, some API calls in the UI could benefit from more specific error handling to provide better user feedback. For example, in `Dashboard/createDraft`, a generic "Failed to create draft" toast is shown for any error.
- **Race conditions or concurrency issues**: The `draftingPlayers` state in `DraftAdminPage` helps prevent some race conditions from double-clicking, which is good. The atomic pick function (`create_draft_pick_atomic`) is an excellent way to prevent race conditions at the database level.
- **Null/undefined reference risks**: The use of TypeScript helps mitigate these risks, but there are places where non-null assertions (`!`) or optional chaining (`?.`) are used where more explicit checks could be safer.

## 6. Improvement Recommendations
- **Prioritized action items (High/Medium/Low)**:
    - **(High)** Refactor the admin access mechanism to remove the `admin_token` from the URL. Pass it via a header or a secure, short-lived cookie.
    - **(Medium)** Implement CSRF protection, especially for forms that modify data.
    - **(Medium)** Add comments to all components and hooks, explaining their props and purpose.
    - **(Low)** Use the Page Visibility API to pause polling in `usePollingFallback` when the tab is not active.
    - **(Low)** Replace manual `fetch` calls with a more robust data-fetching library like `SWR` or `react-query` to get features like caching, revalidation, and request deduplication out of the box.
- **Specific code examples for fixes**: 
    - **Admin Token in URL**: Instead of `router.push(`/draft/${draft.id}/admin/${draft.admin_token}`)`, the admin token could be stored in `sessionStorage` or a cookie and read by the admin page. The API calls already use a header, which is the correct approach.
- **Refactoring suggestions with rationale**: 
    - **State Management**: The state management in `DraftAdminPage` is complex. Consider using a state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit to simplify it, especially as more features are added. This would make the component easier to test and maintain.
- **Testing recommendations**: 
    - The project currently lacks any automated tests.
    - **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for utility functions (`lib/clipboard.ts`, `lib/api-responses.ts`) and hooks.
    - **Component Tests**: Use a library like React Testing Library to test individual components in isolation.
    - **Integration Tests**: Write tests for the API routes to ensure they behave as expected.
    - **End-to-End Tests**: Use a framework like Cypress or Playwright to test user flows like creating a draft, drafting a player, and viewing the draft.
