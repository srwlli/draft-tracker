## Executing Prompt Guide Framework

**Code Context**: [Language/Framework: TypeScript/Next.js 15 (App Router)/React 19/Supabase] [Project Type: Real-time Fantasy Football Draft Management System] [Target Environment: Production (Vercel)]

## Review Framework

### 1. Code Quality & Readability ‚úÖ **Good**

**Variable/function naming conventions**
- Excellent: `useRealtimeRankings`, `generateNonce`, `setSecurityHeaders`
- Consistent camelCase and descriptive names throughout

**Code organization and structure**
- Strong modular separation: hooks, components, middleware, API routes
- Clear file organization with logical grouping
- Recent improvements show good architectural evolution

**Comment quality and documentation**
- Good inline comments explaining complex logic (CSP policies, rate limiting)
- Updated changelog demonstrates good project documentation practices
- Phase documentation shows structured development approach

**Complexity assessment**
- Well-managed complexity with appropriate abstraction layers
- Real-time state management properly encapsulated in custom hooks
- Security middleware cleanly separated with helper functions

### 2. Performance Analysis ‚úÖ **Good**

**Time/space complexity issues**
- Excellent: Parallel queries in public draft endpoint (`Promise.all`)
- Good: Throttling mechanism in real-time updates (100ms)
- Memory management improved with `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>`

**Bottleneck identification**
- Efficient: Narrowed player columns to essential fields only
- Good: Rate limiting with cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Optimized: Real-time deduplication prevents excessive re-renders

**Memory usage patterns**
- Improved: Proper cleanup of timeouts and subscriptions
- Good: Dev-only rate limiter with size caps and eviction

**Optimization opportunities**
- Consider memoization for sorted player lists
- Could implement virtual scrolling for very large player sets

### 3. Security Audit ‚úÖ **Good**

**Input validation gaps**
- Excellent: Comprehensive UUID validation with Zod schemas
- Good: Consistent parameter validation across all routes
- Strong: Admin token timing-safe validation

**Authentication/authorization flaws**
- Excellent: Tokenless admin access removes URL exposure
- Good: Dual authentication patterns (session + admin token)
- Strong: Proper ownership verification before operations

**Data exposure risks**
- Good: Narrowed public endpoint columns
- Excellent: Admin tokens no longer in URLs or browser history
- Strong: Development logging properly gated

**Injection vulnerabilities**
- Excellent: Supabase query builder prevents SQL injection
- Good: Zod validation prevents data corruption
- Strong: CSP headers prevent XSS attacks

### 4. Standards Compliance ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Attention**

**Language-specific best practices**
- Issue: Mixed `params` patterns - some routes still use `Promise<{ id: string }>` with `await`
- Good: Consistent TypeScript typing elsewhere
- Excellent: Proper Next.js App Router patterns in most places

**Framework conventions**
- Issue: Inconsistent route handler param typing needs standardization
- Good: Proper middleware implementation
- Excellent: Modern React patterns with proper hook usage

**Code style guide adherence**
- Good: Consistent formatting and structure
- Excellent: Proper TypeScript interfaces and types

**Architecture pattern compliance**
- Excellent: Clean separation of concerns
- Good: Proper error handling patterns
- Strong: Real-time architecture with fallbacks

### 5. Bug Detection ‚ùå **Critical Issue**

**Logic errors and edge cases**
- Critical: Route handler inconsistency could cause runtime issues
- Good: Race condition prevention in atomic picks
- Good: Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

**Error handling gaps**
- Good: Comprehensive error mapping in API routes
- Excellent: Structured error responses with proper status codes
- Good: Graceful fallbacks for real-time failures

**Race conditions or concurrency issues**
- Excellent: Atomic database functions with row-level locking
- Good: Proper state management in real-time updates
- Strong: Deduplication mechanisms prevent duplicate processing

**Null/undefined reference risks**
- Good: Proper optional chaining usage
- Strong: TypeScript helps prevent null reference errors

### 6. Improvement Recommendations

#### **High Priority (Immediate - 2 hours)**
1. **Standardize Route Handler Parameters**
   ```typescript
   // Fix all routes to use consistent pattern
   { params }: { params: { id: string } }  // No Promise, no await
   ```
   **Impact**: Prevents runtime inconsistencies
   **Files**: All dynamic route handlers

2. **Create Integration Tests for Route Handlers**
   ```typescript
   test('Route handlers use consistent param typing', () => {
     // TypeScript compilation test
   });
   ```
   **Impact**: Prevents regression of param handling patterns

#### **Medium Priority (This Week - 4 hours)**
3. **Implement Automated Security Header Testing**
   ```typescript
   test('Security headers present on all routes', async () => {
     const routes = ['/api/drafts', '/draft/test-id'];
     for (const route of routes) {
       const response = await fetch(route);
       expect(response.headers.get('content-security-policy')).toBeDefined();
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Add CSP Violation Monitoring**
   ```typescript
   // src/app/api/csp-violations/route.ts
   export async function POST(request: Request) {
     const violation = await request.json();
     // Log to monitoring service
   }
   ```

#### **Low Priority (Next Sprint - 6 hours)**
5. **Implement Structured Logging Service**
6. **Add Performance Monitoring for Security Headers**
7. **Create Documentation for Security Policies**

## **Critical Issues Summary**

1. **Route Handler Inconsistency** - Mixed `params` patterns need immediate standardization
2. **Missing Automated Testing** - Security and consistency need test coverage
3. **CSP Rollout Strategy** - Production CSP changes need careful monitoring

## **Strengths Recognition**

- **Excellent Security Evolution**: From URL tokens to secure cookie-based admin access
- **Strong Real-time Architecture**: Proper WebSocket management with fallbacks
- **Good Performance Optimization**: Parallel queries, throttling, memory management
- **Professional Development Process**: Structured phases, comprehensive changelog

**Total Implementation Time**: 12 hours across all priorities  
**Critical Fix Time**: 2 hours for route handler standardization

The codebase demonstrates enterprise-grade patterns with a sophisticated real-time architecture. The main concern is maintaining consistency across the API layer as the system evolves.
