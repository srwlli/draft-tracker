# README.md Maintenance Prompt

  Update the existing README.md file to reflect recent project changes by following these steps:

  ## Instructions
  1. **Read current README.md** - Review existing documentation to understand current state
  2. **Check for changes** - Compare README against actual codebase for outdated information
  3. **Verify commands** - Test all setup/build/dev commands still work correctly
  4. **Update selectively** - Only modify sections that are outdated or incorrect

  ## Update Areas to Check

  ### 1. Tech Stack Changes
  - Check package.json for version updates or new dependencies
  - Verify framework versions are accurate
  - Update any changed development tools

  ### 2. Command Verification
  - Test all documented npm/yarn scripts still exist and work
  - Update any changed command syntax
  - Remove deprecated scripts

  ### 3. Project Structure
  - Check if main directories have been reorganized
  - Update any moved or renamed key files
  - Add new important directories if relevant

  ### 4. Deployment Information
  - Verify live demo links still work
  - Update deployment URLs if they've changed
  - Check if deployment platform changed

  ### 5. Setup Requirements
  - Test environment setup steps still work
  - Update any new environment variables or configuration needs
  - Verify dependency installation process

  ## Maintenance Rules
  - **Preserve existing structure** - Don't reorganize unless necessary
  - **Test before updating** - Verify all changes work before documenting
  - **Minimal changes** - Only update what's actually outdated
  - **Keep it accurate** - Remove any information that's no longer true
  - **No new features** - Don't add features that aren't explicitly requested

  ## Quality Checks
  - All documented commands execute successfully
  - Links are valid and accessible
  - Version numbers match actual package.json
  - Setup instructions work from scratch
  - No broken or outdated references

  ## What NOT to Change
  - Overall structure and tone (unless broken)
  - Working sections that are still accurate
  - Project description (unless fundamentally changed)
  - Well-functioning quick start guides
